# game of life
An implementation of Conway's game of life.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Pygame 1.9.1

## Usage
When the game is paused:
- Click on a cell to change its state (alive/dead)
- Press the right arrow key to move one tick forward

Press any key other than the right arrow key to pause/resume the game.

A cell width of 10-20 pixels seems to perform okay.
